# Treasure Hunt Mapper

My first Spring Boot Application is based on a traditional printed Scavenger Hunt, 
but it multiplies the possible adventures by providing users at different levels tools to 
easily build hunts from a template, or to select from available hunts using search terms.

For example, one user could make a map that represents their favorite Natural History museum.

Another person (or 10, or 100 people!) can use that template to make a hunt that highlights 
their favorite specimens, or that explores a theme.

Eventually users can have countless new places to explore, or new ways to experience old favorites.

Great for teachers, parents, map-makers, and adventurers of all ages!
